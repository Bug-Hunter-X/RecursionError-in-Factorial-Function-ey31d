# RecursionError in Python Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: improper handling of the base case. The `factorial` function, when called with a negative number, leads to infinite recursion and a `RecursionError`. The solution provides a corrected implementation that handles negative inputs gracefully.
